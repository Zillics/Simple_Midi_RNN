# Simple_Midi_RNN

## Goal:
To generate MIDI music in the style of the training samples. 
The implementation steps:
1. Proof of concept for methodology: preprocessing steps, input data format, ML model type, rough understanding of hyperparameters
2. Generate basic monophonic melodies
3. Generate multiple melodies in separate layers (melody,bass,harmonies etc.)

## What I have learned:

- Preprocessing and finding suitable features for describing musical notes
- Creating a generative LSTM network with Keras
- Training of the network on the cloud (using Floydhub)
